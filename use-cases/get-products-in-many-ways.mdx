## Showing a product in multiple ways

In the retail world the fist thing that is seen by users is a home page. Home pages on most pages are rows and/or columns of products.

A sample query that could power a row in the home screen is the following:

query:

```graphql
query HomeScreenRow($searchInput: ProductSearchInput) {
  allProducts(searchInput: $searchInput) {
    id
    title
    description
  }
}
```

with variables of:

```JSON
{
  "searchInput": {
    "titleStartsWith": "Supreme"
  }
}
```

response:

```JSON
{
  "data": {
    "allProducts": [
      {
        "id": "product:2",
        "title": "Supreme x Tiffany & Co. Box Logo Tee",
        "mediaUrl": "https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQWDHD3SSS98UAVKODaql7nrDTopfL4tcTnEltW8Yqy4hyDu4i5b70Wb3Y8-wACJIo5g-ZdRULPQKUmt7JfwiaSdgiOBz4pvU_YelKHUI4nhoXmMJPeh_tyWQ"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This simple approche gives us least amount of data needed to render a row on the home page and give a link to a products page. With the id you can link to a product page with a reltive url of something like `/p/{res.data.allProducts[0].id}` or, in this case `/p/product%3A2` ("%3A" is the encoded value for ":").

When clicked we would go to a PDP (product display page). Using the id in the url we can then make a query like the following to supply all the bulk of the PDPs information:

query:

```graphql
query HomeScreenRow($getProductByIdId: String) {
  getProductById(id: $getProductByIdId) {
    title
    description
    mediaUrl
    variants {
      colorway
      price
      size
    }
  }
}
```

with variables of:

```JSON
{
  "getProductByIdId": "product:2"
}
```

response:

```JSON
{
  "data": {
    "getProductById": {
      "title": "Supreme x Tiffany & Co. Box Logo Tee",
      "description": "A classic Supreme vbox t-shirt in the signature Tiffany blue.",
      "mediaUrl": "https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQWDHD3SSS98UAVKODaql7nrDTopfL4tcTnEltW8Yqy4hyDu4i5b70Wb3Y8-wACJIo5g-ZdRULPQKUmt7JfwiaSdgiOBz4pvU_YelKHUI4nhoXmMJPeh_tyWQ",
      "variants": [
        {
          "colorway": "Tiffany blue",
          "price": 600.25,
          "size": "S"
        },
        {
          "colorway": "Tiffany blue",
          "price": 600.25,
          "size": "M"
        },
        {
          "colorway": "Tiffany blue",
          "price": 600.25,
          "size": "L"
        },
        {
          "colorway": "Tiffany blue",
          "price": 600.25,
          "size": "XL"
        },
        {
          "colorway": "Tiffany blue",
          "price": 600.25,
          "size": "XS"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This data is enough to render the page with a discription, images, what sizes are, and the pices of each size. One of the great things of the things that GraphQL is it load many different things. Now that we have the product described we can display some of this shipping information, and if its in stock.

to get the shipping information we can use the following:

query:

```graphql
query GetVariantShippingInformation($getVariantByIdId: String) {
  getVariantById(id: $getVariantByIdId) {
    dimensions
    weight
  }
}
```

variables:

```JSON
{
  "getVariantByIdId": "variant:4"
}
```

results:

```JSON
{
  "data": {
    "getVariantById": {
      "dimensions": "36inx36inx1in",
      "weight": 30
    }
  }
}
```

This gives us the dimentions for the size small shirt. The following will tell us if there is any in stock and how many:

query:

```graphql
query GetVariantInventoryInformation($getVariantByIdId: String) {
  getVariantById(id: $getVariantByIdId) {
    inventory {
      inStock
      inventory
    }
  }
}
```

variables:

```JSON
{
  "getVariantByIdId": "variant:4"
}
```

results:

```JSON
{
  "data": {
    "getVariantById": {
      "inventory": {
        "inStock": true,
        "inventory": 2
      }
    }
  }
}
```

As you can see from the examples the shcmea in this graph can answer multiple questions.
