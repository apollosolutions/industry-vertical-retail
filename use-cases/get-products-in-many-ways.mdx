## Showing a product in multiple ways

In the retail world the fist thing that is seen by users is a home page. Home pages on most pages are rows and/or columns of products.

A sample query that could power a row in the home screen is the following:

query:

```graphql
query HomeScreenRow($searchInput: ProductSearchInput) {
  allProducts(searchInput: $searchInput) {
    id
    title
    description
  }
}
```

with variables of:

```JSON
{
  "searchInput": {
    "titleStartsWith": "Supreme"
  }
}
```

response:

```JSON
{
  "data": {
    "allProducts": [
      {
        "id": "product:2",
        "title": "Supreme x Tiffany & Co. Box Logo Tee",
        "mediaUrl": "https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQWDHD3SSS98UAVKODaql7nrDTopfL4tcTnEltW8Yqy4hyDu4i5b70Wb3Y8-wACJIo5g-ZdRULPQKUmt7JfwiaSdgiOBz4pvU_YelKHUI4nhoXmMJPeh_tyWQ"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This simple approche gives us least amount of data needed to render a row on the home page and give a link to a products page. With the id you can link to a product page with a reltive url of something like `/p/{res.data.allProducts[0].id}` or, in this case `/p/product%3A2` ("%3A" is the encoded value for ":").

When clicked we would go to a PDP (product display page). Using the id in the url we can then make a query like the following to supply all the bulk of the PDPs information:

query:

```graphql

```

with variables of:

```JSON

```

response:

```JSON

```
