# Retail 

## Problem today in the retail space

- Data consistency
  - One of the harder problems that companies is keeping data consistent. When companies expand the amount of APIs expand. Keeping all the responses consistent can be hard. Between multiple api versions, client apps, and 3rd part integrations.
- Personal experiences
  - Personal experiences has become more and more of a need for a retail companies. These experiences are a huge driver for sales. A graph allows for a seamless trans from normalized to personalized data.
- server driven ui
  - The retail world moves extremely fast. A graph allows you to change your content just as fast with safety. 
- Technical Upkeep
  - Once an app is launched the endpoints that support the app have to stay available for the lifetime of that app. A graph allows you to reduce this technical upkeep by keeping the same but changing where it gets its data.
- Organizational flexibility
  - As the API layer expands, the flexibility decreases. The amount of coordination needed to update experiences is large. A graph allows you to change everything you want as long as the schema stays the same.
